# Change-Default-Khmer-System-Font-on-Windows-All-Versions
This is just a simple fix for Khmer fonts.

Khmer Fonts that come with Windows are:
1. DaunPenh (small size)
2. MoolBoran (small size)
3. PhnomPenh OT (small size)(for some PC)
4. Khmer UI (ugly font)
5. Khmer UI Bold (ugly font)

Here what I've change into:
1. DaunPenh -> Khmer OS Battambang
2. MoolBoran -> Khmer OS Moul Light
3. PhnomPenh OT -> Khmer OS Battambang
4. Khmer UI -> Hanuman UI
5. Khmer UI Bold -> Hanuman UI Bold

The Problem with default Khmer system fonts:
  Microsoft apps (and some other apps) use Khmer UI fonts for interface. It doesn't have any problem, it's just those fonts are a bit ugly to look at. You might see on apps like Microsoft Edge...
  Some other apps use fonts MoolBoran and DaunPenh/PhnomPenh OT for interface. The problem is those fonts size are too small, you might have problem seeing it clearly. And it also ugly. You might see this case on Firefox, Telegram...
